    Charge generation models are used to add to and manipulate data in :py:class:`~pyxel.data_structure.Charge` array
    inside the :py:class:`~pyxel.detectors.Detector` object.
    The values in the :py:class:`~pyxel.data_structure.Charge` array represent charge in electron.
    If the :ref:`photon collection <photon_collection>` model group
    is used, a model like :ref:`Simple photoconversion` needs to be enabled in the pipeline to make the conversion from
    :guilabel:`Photon` to :guilabel:`Charge`.
    Otherwise, a model like :ref:`Load charge` needs to be enabled to initialize the
    :py:class:`~pyxel.data_structure.Charge` array.

      With this model you can create and add charge to :py:class:`~pyxel.detectors.Detector` via
      photoelectric effect by converting photons to charge.
      This model supports both monochromatic and multiwavelength photons, converting either a 2D photon array or
      3D photon array to the 2D charge array.
      If the previous model group :ref:`photon collection <photon_collection>` returns a 3D photon array, the
      photon array will be integrated along the wavelength dimension before applying the quantum efficiency (:term:`QE`).
      
      Binomial sampling of incoming Poisson distributed photons is used in the conversion by default,
      with probability :term:`QE`. It can be turned off by setting the argument ``binomial_sampling`` to ``False``.
      User can provide an optional quantum efficiency (``quantum_efficiency``) parameter.
      If not provided, quantum efficiency from detector :py:class:`~pyxel.detectors.Characteristics` is used.
      It is also possible to set the seed of the random generator with the argument ``seed``.

    description: >
      With this model you can create and add charge to
      :py:class:`~pyxel.detectors.Detector` via photoelectric effect by estimating the
      QE of your detector through an exponential absorption law (:cite:p:`2001:janesick`).

      The QE calculation depends on the detector type (**Back-Illuminated** or **Front-Illuminated**) and incorporates
      various parameters. The equations are as follows:

      1. **Back-Illuminated (BI) Detector**

      The QE for a Back-Illuminated detector is given by:

      .. math::

         QE = CCE \cdot (1 - R) \cdot \left(1 - e^{- \frac{x_{\text{epi}}}{\alpha}} \right)

      With:
      :math:`CCE`: charge collection efficiency (fraction, between 0 and 1);
      :math:`R`: reflectivity (fraction, between 0 and 1);
      :math:`x_{\text{epi}}`: thickness of the epitaxial layer (in cm);
      :math:`\alpha`: absorptivity (in :math:`\text{cm}^{-1}`).

      2. **Front-Illuminated (FI) Detector**

      For a Front-Illuminated detector, the QE calculation includes the additional effect of the poly layer. The formula is:

      .. math::

         QE = CCE \cdot (1 - R) \cdot e^{- \frac{x_{\text{poly}}}{\alpha}} \cdot \left(1 - e^{- \frac{x_{\text{epi}}}{\alpha}} \right)

      With:
      :math:`x_{\text{poly}}`: thickness of the poly layer (in cm), and the other terms as defined above.

      **Temperature-Dependent Absorptivity Correction**

      The absorptivity, :math:`\alpha`, is corrected for temperature changes using the following formula:

      .. math::

         \alpha' = \alpha \cdot e^{c \cdot \Delta T}

      With:
      :math:`\alpha'`: adjusted absorptivity at the new temperature;
      :math:`\alpha`: absorptivity at the reference temperature (300 K);
      :math:`c`: temperature correction coefficient (in :math:`1/\text{K}`).
      :math:`\Delta T`: temperature difference from the reference temperature (in :math:`\text{K}`).

      The embedded conversion coefficient :math:`c` is wavelength and temperature-specific.

      **User-specified coefficients**

      In case you want to operate with your own conversion coefficients, you can add an additional column to the ``.csv``
      file, with a :math:`c` value for each working wavelength.

      .. warning::
          The reference model has been validated at 300 K; the conversion equation may be inaccurate for coefficients measured
          at different temperatures.

      Once the QE is computed for the required wavelength(s) and at the desired temperature, it is applied to the detector
      photon array and a charge array is generated for the next steps of the pipeline.
    notes:
      - This model can operate with monochromatic and multi-wavelength photons.
      - This model is valid only for silicon detectors at the moment.

      This model is not as realistic as CosmiX but it is faster and easier to apply to a wide range of material and particles.

    description: >
      A cosmic ray event simulator was the first model added to Pyxel.
      Initially it was a simple, semi-analytical model in Fortran using the stopping
      power curve of protons to optimize the on-board source detection algorithm
      of the Gaia telescope to discriminate between stars and cosmic rays. Then it
      was reimplemented in Python as TARS (Tools for Astronomical Radiation
      Simulations) and later as CosmiX.

      With this model you can add the effect of cosmic rays to the :py:class:`~pyxel.data_structure.Charge` data structure.
      See the documentation below for descriptions of parameters.
      CosmiX model is described in detail in :cite:p:`2020:cosmix`.

    full_name: Dark current
    detector: all
    status: null
    description: >
      With this model you can add a temperature dependent dark current to charge data,
      stored in the a :py:class:`~pyxel.detectors.Detector` object.
      The model follows the description in :cite:p:`Konnik:noises`.
      The average dark current rate (in :math:`\mathit{e^-/s/pixel}`) is:

      :math:`D_R = \frac{D_{FM}P_{S}}{q}\frac{T^\frac{3}{2}e^{-\frac{E_{gap}}{2k_{B}T}}}{T_{room}^\frac{3}{2}e^{-\frac{E_{g,room}}{2k_{B}T_{room}}}}`

      where

      :math:`T` is temperature (in :math:`K`), :math:`T_{room}` room temperature (:math:`\mathit{300 K}`), :math:`E_{g}` band gap (in :math:`eV`),
      :math:`k_B` Boltzmann constant, :math:`D_{FM}` dark current figure of merit (in :math:`nA/cm^{2}`),
      :math:`P_S` pixel area (in :math:`cm^{2}`), :math:`q` charge of an electron (in :math:`C`)and :math:`E_{g, room}` band gap at room temperature.
      The entire dark current during exposure is:

      :math:`I_{dark}=\mathcal{P}\big(t_{exp}D_R\big)\bigg(1+\mathcal{lnN}\big(0, \sigma^2_{fpn}\big)\bigg)`,

      where :math:`\sigma_{fpn}=t_{exp} D_R D_N`, :math:`\mathcal{P}` Poisson distribution,
      :math:`\mathcal{lnN}` log-normal distribution, :math:`D_N` the dark current spatial noise factor
      and :math:`t_{exp}` exposure time (in :math:`s`).

      To use the model,
      user has to provide arguments ``figure_of_merit`` in :math:`\mathit{nA/cm^2}` (:math:`D_{FM}`),
      ``band_gap`` in :math:`\mathit{eV}`, ``band_gap_room_temperature`` in :math:`\mathit{eV}`, ``spatial_noise_factor`` (:math:`D_N`)
      and ``temporal_noise``.
      If ``temporal_noise`` is true, shot noise will be included.
      The ``spatial_noise_factor`` is typically between 0.1 and 0.4 for CCD and CMOS sensors :cite:p:`Konnik:noises`.

      Parameter ``temperature`` in :math:`\mathit{K}` is taken from detector :py:class:`~pyxel.detectors.Environment`.
      If arguments ``band_gap`` and ``band_gap_room_temperature`` are not provided,
      the model will use the Varshni empirical formula (see :cite:p:`VARSHNI1967149`) with parameters for Silicon by default:

      :math:`E_{gap}(T) = E_{gap}(0) - \frac{\alpha T^2}{T+\beta}`.

      For Silicon, material constants are :math:`E_{gap}(0)=1.1577\mathit{[eV]}`, :math:`\alpha=7.021\times10^{-4}\mathit{[eV/K]}`,
      and :math:`\beta=1108\mathit{[K]}`.

      With this model you can apply APD gain to the a :py:class:`~pyxel.detectors.APD` object.
      Model simply multiplies the values of charge with the avalanche gain,
      which should be specified in the detector characteristics.
    notes: This model is specific to the :term:`APD` detector.

    description: >
      With this empirical model you can add dark current to a :py:class:`~pyxel.detectors.APD` object.
      The model is an approximation the dark current vs. gain vs. temp plot in :cite:p:`2019:baker`, Fig. 3.
      We can split it into three linear 'regimes': 1) low-gain, low dark current; 2) nominal; and 3) trap-assisted tunneling.
      The model ignores the first one for now since this only applies at gains less than ~2.
      All the necessary arguments are provided through the detector characteristics.
      The model works best for ``temperature`` less than 100 and ``avalanche gain`` more than 2.
    notes:
      - This model is specific to the :term:`APD` detector.
      - Dark current calculated with this model already takes into account the avalanche gain.
