    r"""Digitize signal array using :term:`SAR` (Successive Approximation Register) :term:`ADC` logic with noise.

    Successive-approximation-register (:term:`SAR`) analog-to-digital converters (:term:`ADC`)
    for each bit, will compare the randomly perturbated **reference voltage** to
    the voltage of the pixel, adding the corresponding digital value if it is superior.
    The perturbations are generated randomly for each pixel.

    The reference voltage fluctuations are regulated by two parameters, **strength** and
    **noise**, that are set independently for each bit.

    This model and the notes are based on the work of Emma Esparza Borges
    from :term:`ESO`.

    Parameters
    ----------
    detector : Detector
        Pyxel Detector object.
    strengths : tuple of float
        Sequence of ``detector.characteristics.adc_bit_resolution`` number(s). Unit: V
    noises : tuple of float
        Sequence of ``detector.characteristics.adc_bit_resolution`` number(s). Unit: V

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        Raised if parameters ``strengths`` and/or ``noises`` does not have exactly the
        correct numbers of parameters.
        It is expected to have ``detector.characteristics.adc_bit_resolution`` elements.

    Notes
    -----
    The :term:`SAR` :term:`ADC` architecture is based on a binary search algorithm.
    Essentially, it works comparing the analog input to the output of a
    Digital-to-Analog Converter (:term:`DAC`), which is initialized with the
    :term:`MSB` high and all other bits low.
    If the analog sample is higher than the :term:`DAC` output the :term:`MSB` keeps high,
    while if the :term:`DAC` output is higher the :term:`MSB` is set low.
    This comparison is performed for each bit from the :term:`MSB` to the :term:`LSB`
    following the same procedure.

        Simplified N-bit :term:`SAR` :term:`ADC` architecture
        (see https://www.maximintegrated.com/en/app-notes/index.mvp/id/1080).

    Considering a 8-bits :term:`SAR` :term:`ADC`, for the first comparison the
    8-bit register is set to midscale (`10000000`) forcing the :term:`DAC` output
    (:math:`V_{DAC}`) to be half of the reference voltage:
    :math:`V_{DAC}=\frac{V_{REF}}{2}`.
    For the second comparison, if :math:`V_{DAC} < V_{IN}` then the 8-bit register is set
    to `11000000`, if :math:`V_{DAC} > V_{IN}` then the 8-bit register is set to `01000000`.
    In both cases :math:`V_{DAC} = \frac{V_{REF}}{4}`.

    It is essential that :math:`V_{REF}` remains stable through all comparisons
    to be able to perform an accurate conversion from the analog inputs of
    the instrument.

    A potential sources of digitization issues can be modeled by adding
    voltage fluctuations to :math:`V_{REF}` at each stage of the process.

    These fluctuations can be represented by the vectors :math:`\mathit{strength}` and :math:`\mathit{noise}`.
    For a 8-bits :term:`SAR` :term:`ADC`, we have
    :math:`\mathit{strength} = \begin{pmatrix}\mathit{strength}_\mathit{bit7}\\ \vdots\\
    \mathit{strength}_\mathit{bit0}\end{pmatrix}`
    and
    :math:`noise = \begin{pmatrix}\mathit{noise}_\mathit{bit7}\\ \vdots\\ \mathit{noise}_\mathit{bit0}\end{pmatrix}`.

    The fluctuations at each stage of the process (in this case 8 stages) are represented by
    the vector :math:`V^\mathit{perturbated}_\mathit{REF}` with

    .. math::
       \begin{matrix}
       V^\mathit{perturbated}_{\mathit{REF}_\mathit{bit7}} = V_\mathit{REF}
       \left(1 + \mathit{np.random.normal}(\mathit{strength}_\mathit{bit7}, \mathit{noise}_\mathit{bit7})\right)\\
       \cdots\\
       V^\mathit{perturbated}_{\mathit{REF}_\mathit{bit0}} = V_\mathit{REF}
       \left(1 + \mathit{np.random.normal}(\mathit{strength}_\mathit{bit0}, \mathit{noise}_\mathit{bit0})\right)
