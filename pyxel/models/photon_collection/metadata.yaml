    Photon generation models are used to add and manipulate data in :py:class:`~pyxel.data_structure.Photon` array
    inside the :py:class:`~pyxel.detectors.Detector` object. If the :ref:`scene generation <scene_generation>` model group
    is used, a model like :ref:`simple_collection` needs to be enabled in the pipeline to make the conversion from
    :guilabel:`Scene` to :guilabel:`Photon`.
    Otherwise, models like :ref:`Simple illumination` or :ref:`Load image` need to be enabled to initialize the
    :py:class:`~pyxel.data_structure.Photon` array.
    Multiple photon generation models can be linked together one after another.
    The values in the :py:class:`~pyxel.data_structure.Photon` array represent photon flux,
    i.e. number of photons per pixel area per second. The time scale of the incoming flux can be changed in the model arguments.

      Converts scene to photon using a given aperture.
      Initially, a xarray Dataset is extracted from the Scene for a selected wavelength band.
      The ``filter_band`` input represents the wavelength range of the selected filter band.
      By default, the ``filter_band`` argument in :math:`\mathit{nm}` is None, and the information is retrieved from the
      detector properties in the YAML configuration file, where ``cut_on`` and ``cut_off`` wavelengths can be defined
      in the :py:class:`~pyxel.detectors.Detector.Environment`.
      However, you can override this property by providing the ``filter_band`` as a model argument.

      This model supports both monochromatic or multi-wavelength modes, generating a 2D Photon array or 3D Photon array
      as output, whereas the 3D Photon array includes the wavelength dimension.
      When ``integrate_wavelength`` is set to true (default) the monochromatic mode is selected,
      where the flux of objects in the scene is integrated across the wavelength band.
      The integrated flux in :math:`\mathit{photon/(s \cdot cm2)}` is then converted to :math:`\mathit{photon/(s \cdot pixel)}`.
      When ``integrate_wavelength`` set to false, the photons are represented with dimensions "wavelength", "y", and "x".

      The objects are projected onto the detector, with object coordinates converted from :math:`arcsec` to detector
      coordinates (pixel) using the ``pixel_scale`` in :math:`arseconds/pixel`. By default ``pixel_scale`` is None, and
      the model retrieves the ``pixel_scale`` defined in the :py:class:`~pyxel.detectors.Detector.Geometry`.
      However, it is possible to override this property by providing ``pixel_scale`` as model argument.

    detector: all
    status: null
    description: >
      With this model you can add photons to :py:class:`~pyxel.detectors.Detector` by loading an image from a file.
      Accepted file formats are ``.npy``, ``.fits``, ``.txt``, ``.data``, ``.jpg``, ``.jpeg``, ``.bmp``,
      ``.png`` and ``.tiff``. Use argument ``position`` to set the offset from the (0,0) pixel
      and set where the input image is placed onto detector. You can preset positions with argument ``align``.
      Values outside of the detector shape will be cropped.
      Read more about placement in the documentation of function :py:func:`~pyxel.util.fit_into_array`.
      With ``multiplier`` you can multiply the photon number by a custom float,
      and ``time_scale`` is to set the time scale of the incoming photons, default is 1 second.
      By setting ``convert_to_photons`` to ``true`` together with ``bit_resolution``,
      the model converts the values of loaded image array from ADU
      to photon numbers for each pixel using the Photon Transfer Function.
      :math:`\mathit{PTF} = \mathit{quantum\_efficiency} \cdot \mathit{charge\_to\_voltage\_conversion} \cdot \mathit{pre\_amplification} \cdot \mathit{adc\_factor}`.

      ADC conversion factor in this case is :math:`\frac{\max(\mathit{characteristics} \cdot \mathit{voltage\_range})}{2^{\mathit{bit\_resolution}}}`.

      You can check the arguments specification in :ref:`Load image` for more information on setting up the model.

      With this model you can create different simple photon distributions: uniform, elliptical/circular
      or rectangular, by setting the argument ``type``. The calculated photon count will be added to the
      :py:class:`~pyxel.data_structure.Photon` array. User can specify the brightness of the object
      with the argument ``level``. If the distribution is not ``uniform``, then the user also has to provide ``object_size``,
      a list of tho integers, which are the diameters of the object in vertical and horizontal directions.
      Object position can be changed with the argument ``object_position``,
      a list of two integers specifying offset of the object center from pixel (0,0),
      again in vertical and horizontal direction.
      Use the argument ``time_scale`` to set the time scale of the incoming photon flux.

    description: >
      With this model you can add a two-dimensional square signal - a stripe pattern
      to the :py:class:`~pyxel.data_structure.Photon` array. User can specify amplitude with argument ``level``,
      the ``period`` of the square signal in unit of pixels and the ``angle`` of stripes.
      The ``period`` should be a multiple of 2 and equal or larger than 2.
      Argument ``startwith`` is used to flip zero and non-zero values.

    detector: all
    status: null
    description: >
      Use this model to add shot noise to the :py:class:`~pyxel.data_structure.Photon` array.
      By default (no arguments provided), the model uses the Poisson distribution (``numpy.random.poisson``).
      User can also set the argument  ``type`` to ``"normal"`` for normal distribution (``numpy.random.normal``).
      As known, for large photon counts :math:`N` the Poisson distribution approaches the normal distribution
      with standard deviation :math:`\sqrt{N}`, which is fixed in the model.
      It is also possible to set the seed of the random generator with the argument ``seed``.

    description: >
      POPPY (**P**\ hysical **O**\ ptics **P**\ ropagation in **PY**\ thon) model wrapper.

      POPPY :cite:p:`10.1117/12.925230` simulated physical optical propagation including diffraction.
      It implements a flexible framework for modeling Fraunhofer and Fresnel diffraction and point spread function formation,
      particularly in the context of astronomical telescopes.

      POPPY calculates the optical Point Spread Function of an optical system and applies the convolution.
      It requires the Field of View (FOV) in :math:`\mathit{arcsec}` (``fov_arcsec``) and the ``optical_system`` as arguments.
      By default, the model uses ``pixel_scale`` in :math:`\mathit{arseconds/pixel}` and ``wavelength`` in :math:`\mathit{nm}`,
      which are extracted from the detector properties in the YAML configuration file.
      However, you can override these properties by providing them as model arguments.

      The ``wavelength`` input can either be a float for a monochromatic PSF or a tuple for a multi-wavelength PSF calculations.
      Additionally, the ``ThinLens`` optical parameter offers an optional argument ``reference_wavelength``, which, if provided,
      overrides the input wavelength for a single float or calculates the middle wavelength for a range.

      When ``apply_jitter`` is set to true (default is false), pointing jitter will be applied using a Gaussian kernel to convolve
      with the PSF. The width of the jitter kernel is defined by ``jitter sigma`` in :math:`\mathit{arcsec}` per axis,
      with a default value of 0.007 :math:`\mathit{arcsec}`.
